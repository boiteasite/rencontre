A question ? [Rencontre WordPress Support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/rencontre)

More details in french [here](https://www.boiteasite.fr/site_rencontre_wordpress.html).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin doen't works =
Rencontre is now reliable. Most errors that are reported in the support come from improper installation.

* Do you have members ? (see Rencontre Members in Dashboard)
* Are you connected as a member ? (Admin is not a member)
* Did you follow the instructions PRIMO to QUINTO, para Installation ?
* Are you on the right page ? (with the shortcode)

Before start a new topic in the [support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/rencontre), try to find the origin of the error :

* Clear the caches.
* Change wp-config.php to have `define('WP_DEBUG', true);`.
* Use Firebug.
* Googlize your error.

There is no obligation of answer on the support.

= Emails not received =
Rencontre is not responsible for this recurring WordPress problem.
If members don't receive emails when registering (for example), we strongly recommend that you install an SMTP email plugin.
You can use a free solution via your gmail account, or a paid solution for larger volumes.
WP Mail SMTP is the most recommended plugin and is free.

= I'm a newbie and I'm a real beginner with WordPress =
Expect some difficulties. It's a little more than plug and play. Do not wait for the support to do the job for you.

= Useful plugins to work with Rencontre =
* WP GeoNames : Insert all or part of the global GeoNames database in your WordPress base - Suggest city to members.
* WP Mail SMTP : fixes your email deliverability issues by reconfiguring WordPress to use a proper SMTP provider when sending emails.
* Email Templates : Send beautiful emails with the WordPress Email Templates plugin.
* Theme My Login : Creates a page to use in place of wp-login.php, using a page template from your theme.
* Polylang : Use Rencontre in a multilingual environment.

= Conditions to appear in un-logged homepage =
* Wait few days (or reset in admin) ;
* Have a photo on my profile ;
* Have an attention-catcher and an ad with more than 30 characters ;
* Shortcode [rencontre_libre] on the right page or Rencontre::f_ficheLibre() is on the right template.

= How to personalize style =
Rencontre is now using W3.css framework.
You can add your custom css in your theme css file or directly in the dashboard.
To overwrite default css file, add `#widgRenc` (and space) at the beginning of every new line.
Sometimes you also have to add "!important" to overwrite W3CSS rules (see example below).

Example :

`#widgRenc img {padding:1px;}`

Example with Google font :

`@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Coiny'); #widgRenc, #widgRenc .w3-container {font-family:Coiny!important;}`

= Chat and Webcam =

* Chat has only local memory (session). You cannot display the content of a conversation in the Admin side.
* Webcam is not a real streaming but an emulation. The display is refreshed a bit more than every second.
* There's no sound with the webcam. Streaming is not possible on a simple shared hosting without third party.
* HTTPS is mandatory in most case to use the webcam.
* You can change the chat beep : Create two audio files named bip.mp3 and bip.ogg. Move them to /my_theme_folder/templates/.

= Geolocation  =
Geolocation is used to set the GPS location of the user. It works with all devices but :
 
* HTTPS is mandatory,
* Firefox has sometime a bad setting in geo.wifi.uri (about:config),
* The user must accept the request.

Geolocation is activated once per session, only on the account and registration pages.
Geolocation can be enable/disable in Rencontre General options.

By default, geolocation only give the distance between you and another user (xx km from my position).
With the Premium kit, Goelocation is needed to enable the proximity search with map result.

= Facebook =
* Framework for the [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-button?locale=en_US#configurator) Like button : 

`
<div id="fb-root"></div>
<script>(function(d, s, id) {var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) return;js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src="//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document,'script','facebook-jssdk'));</script>
<div class="fb-like" data-href="http://mysite.com" data-layout="button" data-action="like" data-show-faces="false" data-share="true"></div>
`

= How to use unconnected search =
For visitors not connected, you can add a tiny quick search form :

*Method 1* : Shortcode : Add the shortcode `[rencontre_search nb=6]` in your page content. nb is the max result number.

*Method 2* : PHP in your theme (best solution for integrator) :

`<?php if(!is_user_logged_in()) Rencontre::f_rencontreSearch(0, array('nb'=>6) ); ?>`

= How to use Rencontre Templates =

**SIMPLEST METHOD**

Copy the files you have changed in a templates folder of your theme : /my_theme_folder/templates/. Don't copy unchanged files.
Prefer a child theme if you don't want to lose these files after a theme update.

**BEST METHOD**
Create a minimalist plugin just for that (and other filter/functions if you want...).  :

*Plugin structure* : A folder "myPlugin" that contains "myPlugin.php" and a folder "templates".
*myPlugin.php* :

`
<?php
/*
Plugin Name: My Plugin
Description: My plugin to customize the templates.
Version: 1.0
Author: Its Me
License: GPL
Copyright: Its Me
*/
function myTplDir($arg) {
	$arg['path'] = realpath(__DIR__).'/templates/';
	$arg['url'] = plugins_url('myPlugin/templates/'); // name of your plugin !
	return $arg;
}
add_filter('rencTemplateDir', 'myTplDir', 10, 1);
// Others functions here
`

[More details](https://www.boiteasite.fr/site_rencontre_wordpress.html#Developpeurs)

= How to set the plugin multilingual =

**SIMPLEST METHOD**

* Install [Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/).
* Add the Rencontre shortcode(s) on all local homepages (home, home-FR, home-ES, home-DK...).
* If you add Rencontre items to your WP menu, it will be necessary to create a specific WP menu for each language. For languages other than 'default', you will have to fill in the URLs manually for the 'home' page.

**LIGHTEST METHOD**

Add text or little flags in the header of your theme. On click, you create cookie with the right language. Then, the site changes language (back and front office) :

`
<div id="lang">
	<a href="" title="Francais" onClick="javascript:document.cookie='lang=fr_FR;path=/'">Francais</a>
	&nbsp;
	<a href="" title="English" onClick="javascript:document.cookie='lang=en_US;path=/'">English</a>
</div>
`

If you prefer an image flag, replace the content of tag A (English) with something like this :

`<img src="<?php echo plugins_url('rencontre/images/drapeaux/svg/gb.png'); ?>" style="width:36px;" alt="English" />`

= How to customize translation =
The best method is to use 'Loco Translate' plugin to edit a rencontre-xx_YY.po file and create a rencontre-xx_YY.mo file.
Then, copy the po/mo created files from wp-content/plugins/rencontre/lang to wp-content/languages/plugins/.
You can use POEDIT if you prefer.
You can also email us your best version so that we insert it in the plugin.
You can turn off the automatic download of translations in wp-content/languages/plugins/ by adding this filter :

`
add_filter('auto_update_translation', '__return_false');
`

= User role & user removed =
All WordPress roles for the new Rencontre members are removed by this plugin to improve security and speed. That can be a conflict with other plugin.
The members without Rencontre account are automaticaly removed after two days if they can't "edit_posts".

If you want to keep users WP roles, you have just to check the option in the general tab.
Note that if you do this, user deletion (user himself or Admin) will only concern data in Rencontre. Account in WordPress will still exists.

= User registration =
Registration is divided in two part :

* WP registration : email and login Form => clic the email => you are on WP.
* Rencontre registration : phase one to four => you are in rencontre.

With the **fast registration** option :

* WP registration : email and login Form => you are in rencontre with a **limited status**. You have 3 days to complete your account and validate your email to be unlimited.

ADMIN side :

* Members : New user => he is in WP.
* Rencontre / Members : Add new from WordPress => he is in Rencontre.

= Dashboard Access - Moderator =
The Administrator can access to all the Dashboard Rencontre menu.
A BBPress moderator (capability "bbp_moderator") can access to the pages members and jail.

= How to add profil search in search tab (like quick search) =
This is a Premium option. The number of items that can be added is unlimited.

= The automatic sending of emails =
There are two various types of email :

* Regular emails. They give the informations since the precedent regular email. They are sending every month (or 15 or 7 days). One serie during the maintenance hour and another serie the hour after. 
* Instant emails. They just give a instant information (contact request, message in box, smile). There is a sending per hour except during regular emails period. Only one email per person per hour.

= What to include with WP-GeoNames =
The default values are OK.
It's better to limit the data size.
